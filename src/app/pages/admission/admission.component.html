                    At <strong>Pinnaclo Educare</strong>, we follow a structured and merit-based admission process to ensure that students receive the best possible academic guidance. Admission to our courses is granted through a 
                    <strong>Scholarship cum Admission Test (P-SAT or PTQE)</strong>, conducted annually. This test evaluates a student’s <strong>aptitude, foundational knowledge, and subject proficiency</strong>, helping us assess their readiness for our programs.
